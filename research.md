      <summary>Book Blurb</summary>
    How does the Chinese state maintain compliance from the governed in periods of rapid social and economic transformation? The case of pension reform investigated in this book demonstrates that the Chinese state works through benefit allocation, propaganda, experimentation with policy and many other approaches, in order to shape public expectations and justify its rule.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Political leaders in China regularly launch anti-corruption campaigns to restore enforce-ment credibility and win public support.  However, are these high-profile campaignsperceivedassincere or symbolic by the public?  In the case of Xi Jinping’s anti-corruption campaign, we findthat such a sensational and largely genuine anti-corruption effort was not initially taken seriouslyby the stock market, a sensitive public barometer to changing political events.  Using the eventstudy with a most-likely case design, we find that anti-corruption speeches and early crackdownsdid not decrease the stock prices of the firms whose connected officials were later investigated.We  further  argue  that  the  high  costs  of  following  through  and  repeated  campaigns  in  the  pastparadoxically nurtured cynicism.  By exploring the heterogeneous effects of factional links,  weprovide evidence that the stock market initiallyperceivedthe campaign only as a power struggleand misinterpreted the crackdowns on senior officials as signs of the campaign starting to slowdown.  Our findings reveal an inherent dilemma of campaign-style enforcement that could hinderits effectiveness in restoring enforcement credibility and winning public support.</p>

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
COVID-19 has shifted how citizens interact profoundly. Private life is frequently dis- played in the public space and individuals are held to account should their exercise of liberty enlarges COVID-19 transmission risks. We are interested in the evolving dynam- ics among fellow citizens, especially when and how individuals react to others’ COVID-19 related actions and behavior. An extensive data set of Sina Weibo posts consisting of more than four million COVID-19 related posts provides us with a lens to answer the questions. By estimating the general sentiment of Weibo posts from January to Decem- ber 2020, as well as two in-depth case studies, we capture the information flows and discussion volumes in the public space. Combining the machine learning approach with discourse analysis, we find that the psycho-social cycle model identified in past public health emergencies and other societies during the COVID-19 pandemic also occurred in China, although demonstrating unique timing and sequence characteristics that are linked to China’s epidemic situation and policies. The all-society solidarity built at the begin- ning of 2020 was later challenged, and potentially eroded by the process of moralizing fellow citizens’ COVID-related behavior via blaming, discriminating, and scapegoating. As society lives under the pandemic for longer, fellow citizens have become more aware of problems associated with unbounded public scrutiny of private life. Such awareness and reflection, herein, encourages discussion and consensus building efforts.

- **Yan WANG**. Building deservingness and fairness: how Chinese state crafts the social legitimacy of its new welfare schemes. R&R.
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Among the sources that shape people’s idea of ‘who gets what and why’ in social welfare, what is the state's role and what actions might it take to construct public knowledge of the welfare benefits and targeted groups involved to help promote changes in welfare policies? This article takes the pension reform in China in the 1990s and 2000s as an example, uses text data on corresponding policies and propaganda to investigate how the Chinese state framed and legitimised its then-new welfare distribution policies. The results from Quantitative Text Analysis of official discourse demonstrate that, the rationale of reconstructing public knowledge and expectations of the redistribution of pension benefits, and the allocation of welfare responsibility between the state and individuals mainly focuses on the reiteration of the principles of: ‘contribution and rewards’, ‘rights and obligations’. It also built images of deserving and undeserving social groups by reconstructing the notion of fairness, blurring the distinction between merit and equity, and ultimately reshaping individual subjectivity as a self-regulated and self-motivated ‘socialised self’.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Ample studies have investigated how citizens use online space to express their opin- ions, yet less is known about how sub-cultural groups organise and manage their communities online with what political implications. In this article, we focus on one active sub-cultural group in China’s cyberspace—idol-fandom groups—and investi- gate their interaction with the state and the potential political ramifications of the interaction. We focus on the period of Covid-19 pandemic outbreak from Decem- ber 2019 to December 2020—when the pandemic emerged, spread and controlled in China. Drawing from machine learning and discourse analysis of 7,140,433 fandom posts collected from Weibo and eleven interviews with active idol-fans, we argue that the fandom culture in China is a ‘three-way traffic’ that features the interde- pendence between the fans, the idol/company, and the state. In supporting their idols, fans strategically engage in a combination of the capital game—following cap- ital instructions—and political game—seeking the recognition of the state and the mainstream culture the state dominates. Our interviews with active fans demon- strate that fans clearly recognise that nationalism—in particular the benign form of nationalism—is the default setting under the political context in China. Build- ing upon this default setting, they manoeuvre in-between the political and capital games and carefully select the nodes and frames to achieve their non-political goals.

- Xufeng ZHU, **Yan WANG**. Policy experimentation as dialogue: Social policy, shared responsibility, and regime support in China. Under review.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Traditional wisdom on policy experimentation has mainly focused on the relations between the central and local levels. However, scholars have paid little attention to the interaction between policy experimentation and the public. We argue that policy experimentation can be adopted by decision-makers as a dialogue instrument with the public, facilitating the building of a social consensus regarding controversial policies. We evaluate the effects of the Chinese government’s efforts in promoting shared responsibility between the state and the individuals for the urban pension system with policy experimentation on public’s regime support. Evidence from two rounds of a nationwide survey conducted before and after the policy experiment indicates that the implementation of policy experiment has significantly contributed to citizens’ acceptance of individual welfare responsibility. Moreover, the image building of governmental responsibility via local official news coverage immediately consolidates political trust of residents while posing threats to government credibility in the long term.

- **Yan WANG**. Truth or dare: Falsification in manufactured consent. Under review.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Despite state’s well-designed statecraft in shaping public opinions, the risks for the authorities of falsified compliance from the people are present in many post-communist countries. In this paper I ask: is the reported high compliance of the public from all kinds of survey results regarding state representations in China sincere or just falsification? If falsified, how do citizens disentangle the reported consent from their private attitudes? I combine observation and in-depth interviews to unlock the black box and explore the power relationship between state and individual by highlighting ordinary people’s subjectivity and its involution affected by the governmentality of the current authority. The data shows that, falsified compliance does exist among the Chinese regarding the current political system and the authorities, but it is a mixture of intentional falsification and cognitive dissonance. Moreover, individual’s political opinion presents a smooth transformation between the public face and the private face. The interaction between people’s personal experience and the existing cultural, historical and educational factors that have socialised their ideas deeply shapes the presentation of manufactured compliance in authoritarian regimes.

- **Yan WANG**. Pragmatism or politicism:  Local officials’ decisionmaking in policy experimentation. Working Paper.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
It has been widely recognised that local bureaucrats are crucial actors in policy process. In policy experimentation — a popular policy instrument that heavily rely on negotiation and interaction between different sectors, they are main actors that initiate the experimentplan, propose policy innovation, and implement the pilot schemes. Then when would they decide to participate in the policy experiments, and why would they prefer some schemes rather than others?  In this research we conduct an unique conjoint experiment with local officials who are in charge of county - level administrative units in China, investigate their rationale  and  attention  allocation  on  pilot  scheme  preference. The result shows that local officials are practical than political in deciding the preferred  pilot scheme — they value more about the financial support, local condition and risk environment, while the political load of the pilot scheme have less variations in changing their preference.  More importantly, such pattern is consistent across different administrative types and regional subgroups of local officials.
