- Xiaonan WANG, **Yan WANG**. Too Cynical! How Stock Market in China Dismissed Anticorruption Signals. Under review.
Abstract: Anticorruption campaigns are dramatic events with unusually harsh rhetoric and high- profile crackdowns. However, using event study and synthetic control, we found that Xi Jinping’s anticorruption campaign — a sensational and largely genuine anticorruption effort — was not ini- tially taken seriously by the stock market. Early anticorruption speeches and crackdowns did not decrease the stock prices of the firms whose connected officials were later investigated. To explain the puzzling results, we argue that the high costs of following through and repeated campaigns in the past paradoxically nurtured cynicism. By exploring the variations of factions, we provide evidence that the stock market initially perceived the campaign only as a power struggle and mis- interpreted the crackdowns on senior officials as signs of the campaign starting to slow down. Our findings cast doubt on the effectiveness of campaign-style enforcement, even in the short term.
