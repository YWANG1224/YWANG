    Economic growth is often a disruptive social process - so how has the Chinese state been able to maintain compliance from its people while at the same time pushing ahead an exceptionally rapid social and economic transformation? This book explores the question via detailed analysis of the trajectories, policy rationale, and effects of China’s pension reforms, demonstrating how statecraft shapes the ways that citizens ascribe credit and responsibility for pensions protection across themselves, the state and other actors. The book shows that China’s governmentality for manufacturing compliance is hybrid, organic, and dynamic. The targeted allocation of benefits, policy experimentation, propaganda and knowledge construction, and many other approaches are used to shape public expectations and to justify state rule. An original contribution to the study of legitimation in modern states, the analysis particularly highlights that when active counter-conduct (such as resistance) is confined, individuals may choose cognitive rebellion and falsify their public compliance.

      <summary>Abstract</summary>
    Traditional wisdom on policy experimentation has mainly focused on central-local relations. However, scholars have paid little attention to the interaction between policy experimentation and the public. We argue that policy experimentation can be adopted by decision makers as a communication instrument with the public, facilitating the building of a social consensus regarding controversial policies. We evaluate the effects of the Chinese government’s efforts in promoting shared responsibility between the state and the individuals for the urban pension system with policy experimentation on public’s regime support. Evidence from two rounds of a nationwide survey conducted before and after the policy experiment indicates that the implementation of policy experiment has significantly contributed to citizens’ acceptance of individual welfare responsibility. Moreover, the image building of governmental responsibility via official news with varied intensity across local regions immediately consolidates the political trust of residents while posing threats to government credibility in the long run.

      <summary>Abstract</summary>
    Chinese idol fans have been identified among the main forces in cyber nationalist activisms in recent years, acting as the nationalist fans protecting the state as an idol in response to external political shocks. Their skills in acknowledging, involving, and even reinventing the image of the state and national pride in cyber nationalist activisms do not emerge in a vacuum. This article examines how idol fans involve and reinvent the nationalist discourse in their everyday fan activities – idol promotion. We focus on the pandemic in 2020 as it provides a specific social and political context that allows us to understand better the interaction between idol fans and the state in their mundane fan activities. We construct our analysis under the computational grounded theory framework with over 6 million fan posts collected from Weibo and 11 in-depth interviews with active idol fans. Our findings show that when engaging in pandemicrelated discussion, idol fans actively borrowed official discourse on nationalism and strategically responded to key political and social events in their idol promotion activities. The idol images they built are not only positive but also nationalist. Therefore, they play not only the commercial logic commonly seen in the Japanese and Korean Kpop/idol culture but also the political logic propagated by the state in China.

      <summary>Abstract</summary>
    Political leaders in China regularly launch anti-corruption campaigns to win public support. But how are anti-corruption signals perceived? We use event study to examine the case of Xi Jinping’s anti-corruption campaign – an unprecedented effort in China to fight corruption. Contrary to expectations, we find that for the firms with connected officials later investigated, the initial anti-corruption signals – speeches from the top leadership and earlier crackdowns on other senior officials – did not decrease their stock prices. We argue that the perceived high costs of following through and repeated campaigns in the past paradoxically nurtured cynicism. We exploit the case of Zhou Yongkang and Ling Jihua – the two officials who were alleged to be involved in the power struggle and whose downfall had circulated widely since 2012. We find that when the targets of earlier crackdowns were connected to Zhou or Ling, the stock prices of the firms went down only if their connected and later investigated officials were in the same faction; the stock prices of the other firms, however, went up. We interpret the results as investors’ misperceptions of the campaign in the beginning. Our findings suggest that even real efforts in campaign-style enforcement can be dismissed.

- **Yan WANG**. Pragmatism or politicism: Local officials’ decision making in policy experimentation. 2022. *SSRN* <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4222285">Available here</a>
    <details>
      <summary>Abstract</summary>
    It has been widely recognized that local bureaucrats are crucial actors in policy process. In policy experimentation—a popular policy instrument in social welfare areas—which heavily relies on negotiation and interaction between different sectors, local bureaucrats are the main actors that initiate the experiment plan, propose policy innovation, and implement the pilot schemes. Then what do they value when deciding on local social policies, and why would they prefer some policy-experiment schemes over others? In this research, we use two unique studies with survey experiments on municipal- and county-level government officials in China and investigate their rationale and attention allocation on social policy preferences, as well as their decision making on policy experiments. Our results show that although the instruction and support from the upper-level governments are as vital as the local initiatives, local officials are more practical than political in many scenarios of local social policy making, where under similar conditions they react more strongly to societal demands. This pragmatism is especially true in deciding the preferred pilot scheme—they place more value on financial support, local conditions, and risk environment, while the political load of the pilot schemes have relatively less leverage in changing their preference. More importantly, such a pattern is consistent across different administrative types and regional subgroups of local officials.

      <summary>Abstract</summary>
    COVID-19 has shifted how citizens interact profoundly. Private life is frequently dis- played in the public space and individuals are held to account should their exercise of liberty enlarges COVID-19 transmission risks. We are interested in the evolving dynam- ics among fellow citizens, especially when and how individuals react to others’ COVID-19 related actions and behavior. An extensive data set of Sina Weibo posts consisting of more than four million COVID-19 related posts provides us with a lens to answer the questions. By estimating the general sentiment of Weibo posts from January to Decem- ber 2020, as well as two in-depth case studies, we capture the information flows and discussion volumes in the public space. Combining the machine learning approach with discourse analysis, we find that the psycho-social cycle model identified in past public health emergencies and other societies during the COVID-19 pandemic also occurred in China, although demonstrating unique timing and sequence characteristics that are linked to China’s epidemic situation and policies. The all-society solidarity built at the begin- ning of 2020 was later challenged, and potentially eroded by the process of moralizing fellow citizens’ COVID-related behavior via blaming, discriminating, and scapegoating. As society lives under the pandemic for longer, fellow citizens have become more aware of problems associated with unbounded public scrutiny of private life. Such awareness and reflection, herein, encourages discussion and consensus building efforts.

- **Yan WANG**. Building deservingness and fairness: how Chinese state crafts the social legitimacy of its new welfare schemes. R&R.
    <details>
      <summary>Abstract</summary>
    How do modern states legitimise and frame their redistributive social policies in communicating with society to promote policy changes? What kind of ‘structures of incentives’ are being promoted in their narratives? This article takes the pension reform in China in the 1990s and the 2000s as an example, using text data on corresponding official propaganda to investigate the Chinese state’s ideological repertories in framing and crafting the social legitimacy of its then-new pension designs. The results from Quantitative Text Analysis of official discourse demonstrate that the rationale for reconstructing public expectations of the redistribution of pension benefits and the allocation of welfare responsibility between the government and individuals mainly focuses on the reiteration of the principles of: ‘contribution and rewards’ and ‘rights and obligations.’ The state also built images of deserving and undeserving social groups by reconstructing the notion of fairness, blurring the distinction between merit and equity, and ultimately reshaping individual subjectivity as a self-regulated and self-motivated ‘socialised self’.    </details>


- **Yan WANG**. Truth or dare: Falsification in manufactured consent. Under Review.
    <details>
      <summary>Abstract</summary>
    Despite state’s well-designed statecraft in shaping public opinions, the risks for the authorities of falsified compliance from the people are present in many post-communist countries. In this paper I ask: is the reported high compliance of the public from all kinds of survey results regarding state representations in China sincere or just falsification? If falsified, how do citizens disentangle the reported consent from their private attitudes? I combine observation and in-depth interviews to unlock the black box and explore the power relationship between state and individual by highlighting ordinary people’s subjectivity and its involution affected by the governmentality of the current authority. The data shows that, falsified compliance does exist among the Chinese regarding the current political system and the authorities, but it is a mixture of intentional falsification and cognitive dissonance. Moreover, individual’s political opinion presents a smooth transformation between the public face and the private face. The interaction between people’s personal experience and the existing cultural, historical and educational factors that have socialised their ideas deeply shapes the presentation of manufactured compliance in authoritarian regimes.

- Ting LUO, **Yan WANG**. The art of storytelling: Pro-regime narratives on Chinese social media and the official opinion leaders. Working paper. 
    <details>
      <summary>Abstract</summary>
    The Chinese government under Xi Jinping has taken an active role in shaping and leading online discussions in cyberspace in order to occupy the battlefield of online public opinion (Creemers 2017). While much is known about the strategies and tactics used by various online actors to promote pro-regime messages, we know little about how narratives are constructed in these messages. In this paper, building upon a sociological approach of narrative analysis and the narrative policy framework (Tilly, 1997; Franzosi, 1998; Boscarino 2022; Gupta, Ripberger, and Wehde 2018; Merry 2019), we identify narratives and storytelling in the pro-regime messages promoted by opinion leaders on Chinese social media platform. We drew a random sample of all Weibo verified users and collected all posts posed by them between January and May 2022, yielding a total of over three million posts by 38,068 verified users, including government accounts, organizations, enterprises, media, and influential opinion leaders. By unpacking the key topics in the corpus, we uncovered four trending topics related to four key social-economic events at the time—the Beijing Winter Olympics, the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Shanghai Lockdown, and the chained mother likely to be a victim of human trafficking found in Jiangsu Province. Each of these events features unique scenarios—state-sponsored events, international disputes, and domestic social events—the state tends to involve influencing the public opinion. Further with modified linguistic algorithm that captures the action, the agent performing that action, and the patient being acted upon, we unravel the storytelling feature of the plots and the meaning construction of subject-object-action network. Our work shed new light on how online opinion leaders construct the narratives and stories in various scenarios, as well as the relationship between the state, platforms, and the public in discipling public opinion and constructing societal knowledge in authoritarian regimes.
