I am a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) in Social Statistics at [The University of Manchester](https://www.socialsciences.manchester.ac.uk/social-statistics/), previously a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) in Digital Sociology at the [Lancaster University](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/sociology/). Before I was a Research Fellow at [School of Public Policy](https://www.lse.ac.uk/school-of-public-policy) at the [London School of Economics and Political Science](https://www.lse.ac.uk/), previously a LSE fellow in the [Department of Methodology](https://www.lse.ac.uk/methodology). I'm also a fellow at the [Data Science Institute](https://www.lse.ac.uk/DSI), and visiting fellow at SPP, LSE. 

My research seeks to understand the issues relates to public opinion and political communications in cyberspace, state legitimacy and governance, as well as the redistribution of public goods. I'm especially interested in the social cleavage of public opinion in the digital world, moreover, how and why public opinion changes during state-society interactions. I also interested in the realisation of the publicâ€™s social rights and welfare equalisation from a comparative perspective. My methodological research interests include quantitative methods broadly, such as machine learning, causal identification, text analysis, and social network analysis. 

I received a BS in Sociology and a MA in Management, from the [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), and a PhD in [Sociology](https://www.lse.ac.uk/sociology), from the London School of Economics and Political Science.
