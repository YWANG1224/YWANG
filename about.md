Yan is a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) in Digital Sociology at the [Department of Sociology at Lancaster University](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/sociology/). Before she was a Research Fellow at [School of Public Policy](https://www.lse.ac.uk/school-of-public-policy) at the [London School of Economics and Political Science](https://www.lse.ac.uk/), previously a LSE fellow in the [Department of Methodology](https://www.lse.ac.uk/methodology). She is also a visiting fellow at the [Data Science Institute](https://www.lse.ac.uk/DSI), and visiting senior fellow at SPP, LSE. Her research seeks to understand the issues of state legitimacy, public opinion, and the redistribution of public goods. She is especially interested in how actors’ agency shapes authoritarian governmentality and the realisation of public’s social rights, and how and why public opinion changes during the state-society interactions. She is also interested in welfare equalisation in a comparative perspective, and state governance in general. 

Yan received a BS in Sociology and a MA in Management, from the [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), and a PhD in [Sociology](https://www.lse.ac.uk/sociology), from the London School of Economics and Political Science.
